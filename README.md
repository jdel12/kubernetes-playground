A basic kubernetes setup
==============
If kubernetes means captain, this is a pirate captain with a casual attitude towards best practices but this is how you learn.

This is serving as a general area for me to write yamls and implement them on a GCP account BUT the primary infrastructure that exists here is based around showing the latest equity prices for specific companies via an nginx web server and supported by a elasticsearch database.
